## Description
Hello you, crack addicts! This is a proof of concept of what an O-Grader could be. The idea is that Adam tells you if he's climbed the route, Pete gives you the O-grade and Tom rants on something.

## How to Use
Download the zip file and unzip it Open *o-grader.html* with your preferred browser. Load the json file. Enter the name of a route and enjoy!

## Limitations
- Only perfect makes will work, if there's a typo it won't.
- The json file nust be loaded manually as most browsers will block it if it's done automatically.
- 8a.nu only tells us if the climb was: "onsight", flash", "send" or "redpoint", limiting us to O0-, O0, O1 and O1+ (i.e. any grades above O1).
- Adam's comments might allow us to scrape the number of sessions it took him to send his big projects.
- Tom only rants about Dave's sandbagging.
- Adam hasn't logged the boulder *La Marie-Rose (6A)* which is (probably) the most achievable O1 on the planet.
- ...

## How to update it
For the time being this part isn't automated, so you need to update the *Logbook of Truth* (Adam's logbook) yourself. To do so go to: https://www.thecrag.com/en/article/export8a and enter "adam-ondra" in the designated field and wait for ages until the processing is done. Then download the file and convert it into a json file, for example by using https://csvjson.com/csv2json.

## Making it look nicer
By respect for the artist's work and the WideBoyz' merch, I only provide a blurred image. However, if you appear to have access to the picture in a good quality just subsitute it for the low-quality "ondra_n_wideboyz.jpg".
